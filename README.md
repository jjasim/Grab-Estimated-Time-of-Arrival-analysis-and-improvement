# Grab-Estimated-Time-of-Arrival-analysis-and-improvement

## Problem
Grab Holdings Inc., commonly known as Grab, is a Southeast Asian technology company headquartered in Singapore and Indonesia. Much of their business is centred around transporting people and food from place to place. As most online delivery and transportation apps do, the Grab application provides an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to their customers about the arrival of their products or services. 

However, recently there has been a growing number of complains about inaccurate ETAs around Jakarta, Indonesia. As a result, this analysis seeks to find possible causes of this inaccuracy.
